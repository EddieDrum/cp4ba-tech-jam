# Labs

## Overview

The table below lists all capabilties that we currently have labs for. A capability may contain one or more labs depending on the complexity. It is recommended that during the Jam, you prioritize the capabilties that you are interested in and the ones that depend on the Jam infrastructure.

To earn a badge for a specific capability, you must complete all labs for it and answer the quiz linked in the table below.

## System URLs

Most labs require you to access one or more systems set up specifically for the Jam. 

The easiest way to access these is to import the bookmarks into your browser using [this bookmarks file](Bookmarks.html). You can import this file into Chrome or Firefox using the default import bookmarks mechanisms for each browser. After the import is complete, you can use the "EMEA Jam" folder in your bookmarks to access the required systems.

You can optionally access the systems using the links below:

- [Client Onboarding Desktop](https://navigator-ibm-cp4ba.tech-jam-apac-464887bc828751e1b00625ca9211fbca-0000.che01.containers.appdomain.cloud/navigator/?desktop=ClientOnboarding)

- [IBM Business Automation Studio](https://bas-ibm-cp4ba.tech-jam-apac-464887bc828751e1b00625ca9211fbca-0000.che01.containers.appdomain.cloud/BAStudio)

- [ADS ML Service](http://ads-ml-service-service-ibm-ads-ml-service.tech-jam-apac-464887bc828751e1b00625ca9211fbca-0000.che01.containers.appdomain.cloud)

- [IBM Business Performance Center (BPC)](https://business-performance-center.bai.ibm-cp4ba.tech-jam-apac-464887bc828751e1b00625ca9211fbca-0000.che01.containers.appdomain.cloud)

**Note:** Some labs may require you to access an environment in Asset Repo instead of the Jam infrastructure. If that is the case, the lab will specify instructions on how to access that environment.

## Login Credentials

To access the systems in the Jam ROKS cluster, you will need a username and password. You can retrieve your unique credentials using the chatbot (built using IBM RPA) [here](http://159.122.122.170/UserManagement/).

**Note:** For labs that require you to access systems outside the Jam infrastucture, the lab document will specify separate login credentials.
